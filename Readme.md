# Classifying Pastas

What do you do when you are new in *Italy* and unable to determine what kind of pasta is being served to you?

> Its simple use Machine Learning!

* The main task here is that we have 4 different kinds of pastas and we need to classify them
* For each kind of pasta we have around 1000 images

The different kinds of pastas are -
1. Ragu 	 
2. Carbonara 	 
3. Lasagna 	 
4. gnocchi

> The problem can be solved using SVM kernel combinations or artificial neural networks
> Interpretations and explanations are included in the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mmd52/MLCE/blob/master/Classifying_Pastas.ipynb)

# How to Navigate 
* There is just one jupyter notebook
* To download the data go here - ***https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dDMWnXzQS4RTGWiPUMIQblDNu_iTkAvD***
